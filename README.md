# ludo
An immersive virtual environment designed for the analysis of manual proprioception and motor control. Subjects perform a series of eye-hand coordination tasks, tracking and intercepting an array of stimulus objects. A visualization of the user's hand is rendered for use in these "catch" or "repel" (intercept) activities. As "difficulty" scales, the speed of the stimulus object will increase and the opacity of the user's in-game hand will decrease. Without visual confirmation of hand location, the user is forced to use proprioceptive sensors while completing trials.
