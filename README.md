# ludo
An immersive virtual environment designed for the analysis of manual proprioception and motor control. Users perform a series of eye-hand coordination tasks, tracking and intercepting an array of stimulus objects. Visualizations of user hands are rendered for use in these "catch" or "repel" activities. As difficulty scales, the speed of the stimulus object will increase and the opacity of the user's visualized hand will diminish. Without the visual confirmation of hand/limb location, the user is forced into the exclusive use of proprioceptive sensors to successfully complete the trials.
