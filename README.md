# Description
*XPL* is an immersive virtual environment designed for the analysis of manual proprioception and motor control. Subjects perform a series of eye-hand coordination tasks, tracking and intercepting an array of stimulus objects. For use in these intercept activities, a visualization of the user's hand is rendered via [Unity's](https://unity3d.com/) access to a [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/) controller. Hand data is concurrently captured and stored as part of the program output, making possible a finer grade of motor control analysis. As "difficulty" scales, the speed of the stimulus object will increase and the opacity of the in-game hand will decrease. Without visual confirmation of hand location, the user is compelled to estimate manual placement via proprioception.
