# ludo
An immersive virtual environment designed for the analysis of manual proprioception and motor control. Subjects perform a series of eye-hand coordination tasks, tracking and intercepting an array of stimulus objects. For use in these "catch" or "repel" (intercept) activities, a visualization of the user's hand is rendered via Unity's access to a Leap Motion Controller. Hand data is concurrently captured and stored as part of the program output, making possible a finer grade of motor control analysis. As "difficulty" scales, the speed of the stimulus object will increase and the opacity of the user's in-game hand will decrease. Without visual confirmation of hand location, the user is forced to use proprioceptive sensors while completing trials.
